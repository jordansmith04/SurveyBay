The SurveyBay app allows coordinators to create surveys, modify existing surveys and share surveys with others via email. All surveys will be multiple choice. Coordinators can view results of the survey as a percentage of participants that answered with a given answer, eg. 45% answered A on Question 1. Users can complete surveys and will receive email confirmation upon completion.
